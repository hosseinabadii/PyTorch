# Improving a Model with PyTorch

When facing an underfitting problem in your neural network model, there are several strategies you can employ to enhance its performance. These strategies revolve around tuning the model's hyperparameters. Here's a deeper dive into some of these techniques, with special attention to activation functions, loss functions, and optimization algorithms.

## Model Improvement Techniques

- **Add more layers**: Increasing the depth of your neural network allows it to learn more complex patterns. Each additional layer can potentially extract a new level of abstraction from the data.

- **Add more hidden units**: By making your neural network wider, you give it more capacity to learn. More hidden units per layer can enhance the model's ability to capture nuances in the data.

- **Fitting for longer (more epochs)**: Giving your model more iterations to learn from the data can improve its accuracy. However, be cautious of overfitting.

- **Changing the activation functions**: Activation functions introduce non-linearity to the model, enabling it to learn complex relationships in the data. Different functions can be used depending on the specific requirements of the neural network layer.

    - **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: ReLU is widely used for hidden layers because of its simplicity and efficiency. It introduces non-linearity by outputting the input directly if it is positive, else, it will output zero.

    - **Sigmoid**: Often used in the output layer for binary classification tasks, the sigmoid function squashes the input values to a range between 0 and 1, making it suitable for estimating probabilities.

- **Change the learning rate**: Adjusting the learning rate of the optimizer can significantly affect model performance. The right learning rate ensures that the model learns efficiently without overcorrecting.

- **Change the loss function**: Selecting the appropriate loss function is crucial for guiding the optimization process effectively.

    - **Binary Cross Entropy Loss**: Ideal for binary classification problems. When combined with the sigmoid activation function in the output layer, it effectively models the probability of the inputs belonging to one of two classes.

    - **Cross Entropy Loss**: Used for multi-class classification problems. It is generally combined with the softmax activation function in the output layer, which helps in predicting the probability distribution over multiple classes.

- **Use transfer learning**: Leveraging a pre-trained model and fine-tuning it for your specific task can save time and resources, especially when the pre-trained model comes from a related domain.

## Optimization Functions

The choice of optimization function (optimizer) is crucial for training deep learning models effectively. Here are some commonly used optimizers:

- **SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)**: A simple yet effective optimizer. It updates the model's parameters using the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters.

- **Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)**: Combines the advantages of two other extensions of stochastic gradient descent â€“ Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad) and Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp). It is particularly effective for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters.

- **Others**: There are many other optimizers available, such as RMSprop, Adadelta, and Adamax, each with its own strengths in different scenarios.

By carefully selecting and tuning these hyperparameters, you can significantly improve your model's performance and overcome underfitting problems. Remember, the choice of activation functions, loss functions, and optimizers depend on the specific characteristics of your data and the problem you are trying to solve.
